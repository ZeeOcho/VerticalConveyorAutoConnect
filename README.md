# Vertical Conveyor Auto-Connect

Automatically bridges aligned vertical conveyor endpoints across blueprint
boundaries with vanilla Conveyor Lifts.

The mod is intended for vertically stacked blueprints where a conveyor path
would otherwise need to be reconnected manually after every placement.

Disclaimer: Generative AI (ChatGPT) was used extensively by me to generate pretty
much all code, documentation and artwork. I still in-game-tested the functionality
to make sure it works correctly. I also made my best efforts to check all generated
text and code (I am not a C++ developer).

I neither have much time nor any knowledge of Satisfactory Modding. And since I expect
CSS to eventually implement this kind of feature themselves, I decided to throw AI at it.
That way, I will still have this functionality until that happens.

What you also should now: attachment connections are still a little finnicky even in
vanilla itself. For example: when you are trying to build a lift between a floor hole and
and open vertical attachment (*-splitter, *-merger), you can only start at the attachment side,
not at the floor hole (the lift will not snap to the attachment). This means:
1. We cannot auto-connect (or manually build) between to open attachments.
2. Mind this when build in blueprints. Be especially careful when deleting connections.
   Double-check the remaining connections to make sure they still transport items. You might
   need to re-build them.

## Supported connections

| Blueprint/world boundary endpoints | Result |
|---|---|
| Conveyor Floor Hole ↔ Conveyor Floor Hole | Supported |
| Conveyor Floor Hole ↔ compatible Splitter/Merger lift port | Supported |
| Compatible Splitter/Merger lift port ↔ Conveyor Floor Hole | Supported |
| Splitter/Merger lift port ↔ Splitter/Merger lift port | Not synthesized |

"Compatible Splitter/Merger" is capability-based rather than a hard-coded class
list. Normal Splitters/Mergers, Smart and Programmable Splitters, and Priority
Mergers are supported. Modded or future variants are supported automatically
when they use Satisfactory's standard `AFGBuildableConveyorAttachment` vertical
lift-port contract.

Attachment ↔ attachment bridges are intentionally not synthesized because
vanilla Conveyor Lift placement cannot complete that topology manually.

## Lift tier selection

When a bridge needs a Conveyor Lift tier:

1. the adjacent lift on the **blueprint side** wins;
2. otherwise the adjacent lift on the **world/target side** is used;
3. if neither side provides a lift tier, no bridge is created.

This lets a blueprint define its preferred lift tier while still allowing a bare
blueprint endpoint to inherit the tier of the structure it is stacked onto.

## Placement and collision behavior

The generated bridge uses a real vanilla Conveyor Lift hologram for placement
validation.

- Soft-clearance/yellow placements remain constructible when vanilla allows them.
- Hard-invalid placements are rejected when vanilla rejects them.
- The mod does not add guessed maximum heights, distances, clearance rules, or
  angular tolerances.

The first physical vertical conveyor endpoint in a column terminates the search.
The mod never skips through an occupied, unsupported, claimed, or incompatible
endpoint to connect to a farther one.

## General hints

### Rebuild seam connections after topology-changing blueprint edits

Satisfactory can preserve serialized conveyor connection state on surviving
buildables when part of an already-connected conveyor graph is removed from a
blueprint. A seam-adjacent Conveyor Lift, Conveyor Floor Hole, Splitter, Merger,
or variant can therefore still look geometrically correct while its saved
connection/snap state no longer matches the edited blueprint.

**General rule:** after an edit changes the conveyor topology at a future
blueprint seam, dismantle and rebuild the conveyor connections immediately
adjacent to that seam before saving the final blueprint.

This is especially relevant to a "master blueprint" workflow:

1. build and save one fully connected combined blueprint;
2. save copies for the upper/lower variants;
3. delete the opposite part from each copy;
4. rebuild the seam-local conveyor connections in each resulting blueprint;
5. save the final variants.

You normally do **not** need to rebuild the entire conveyor network. The
seam-local Lift / Floor Hole / Splitter / Merger relationships are the important
ones.

This is a general Satisfactory blueprint-editing precaution rather than a
requirement invented by this mod: visual alignment alone does not guarantee that
vanilla still considers two conveyor elements semantically connected.

## Compatibility

- Satisfactory 1.2
- Satisfactory Mod Loader 3.12.x
- No custom buildables or items are added.
- Capability-compatible conveyor-attachment variants from other mods may work
  automatically; non-standard attachment implementations fail closed.

### Multiplayer / dedicated servers

**Multiplayer has not been tested and is not currently advertised as supported.**

The implementation uses Satisfactory/SML's blueprint construction-message path
and avoids custom replicated actors or RPCs, so the architecture is intended to
be multiplayer-compatible. However, no host/client or dedicated-server test has
been performed. Users should therefore treat multiplayer behavior as unverified.

By default, SML requires the same mod version on both sides. Dedicated-server
release targets should not be advertised as supported unless they are tested in
a future release.

## Troubleshooting

If an endpoint looks aligned but does not auto-connect:

1. verify that vanilla can manually continue the conveyor through that endpoint;
2. for Floor Holes, verify the existing continuation is actually snapped through
   the hole rather than only geometrically aligned;
3. after splitting or heavily editing a previously connected blueprint, rebuild
   the seam-local conveyor connections and save it again.

For detailed bug reports, include the Satisfactory version, SML version, mod
version, endpoint topology, intended flow direction, and a game log.
